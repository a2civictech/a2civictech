etrakit is the City of Ann Arbor's permit and project tracking system.
It's on a web service that does not have permalinks, so it's not possible
to easily and directly connect to all documents for a project.

etrakit is a product of Sungard, which acquired the software's inventor
CRW Systems in 2015.
