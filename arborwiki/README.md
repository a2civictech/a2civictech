arborwiki is part of the localwiki project.

A desired goal is to maintain a local mirror of all of the data
in the Arborwiki collection, so that there's a local backup for
analysis. This should be doable through the Localwiki API.

The minimalist task is to pull down the latest edition of any
given single page as a JSON blob.
