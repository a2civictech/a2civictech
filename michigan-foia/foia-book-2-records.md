# Chapter 2: Records available via FOIA requests

There is a wide variety of records held by most Michigan government
bodies that can be retrieved through the FOIA process. Here is a
list of some of these, with suggestions for how you might phrase a
request for records to maximize the chance that you’ll get what you
are looking for with a minimum of costs as quickly as possible.

Whenever possible, this list also includes and makes suggestions for
obtaining records outside of the FOIA process, either through public
databases or other sources of public records.

## Agendas, board packets, and minutes of meetings

When public bodies hold a public meeting, they typically
prepare an agenda of the matters to be discussed or decided
at that meeting, as well as a board packet for members of
the board to prepare them for the meeting. These are public
records, and should be available upon request.

After a meeting, the public body has 8 business days to produce
draft minutes of that meeting; this too is a public record.
You may find a FOIA request is helpful in obtaining timely
copies of draft minutes, since they might not be published
in official form until after the next meeting of the board approves them.

~~~~~~~~
Please provide the following records:

1. A copy of the draft minutes for the Building Board of Appeals
meeting held on 16 December 2013.
2. A copy of the board packet and meeting agenda for that meeting.
~~~~~~~~

Note that draft meeting minutes may be the only minutes available if
the public body does not approve the minutes at a subsequent meeting.
It can take months for some public bodies to get around to approving
minutes, so being a stickler for draft minutes may be the only way to
get a public record of a meeting.

## Bids and contracts

If you are doing business with a government, you should know that
the bids and contracts associated with awards are a matter of public
record. By making records requests for the bids of competing
organizations you can obtain details that may be helpful in preparing
your next bid or proposal.

Note that bids are exempt from disclosure until the contract has
been awarded.

For fastest service, provide as much information about the bidding
process as you can locate, including contract numbers, full names
of winning or losing bidders, and exact or approximate dates. You’ll
almost certainly want to ask for documents in electronic format if
possible to save reproduction costs. A good working relationship
with the purchasing coordinator for the public body can help save
a step in many cases, since they may be able to release bid records 
without the need for a formal FOIA request once the bid has been awarded.
You may also be able to find identifying numbers or names for larger
bids by examining the minutes of a public body, as many of them have
requirements that sufficiently large awards are to be approved by an
elected official.

Michigan municipalities often bid their contracts through MITN,
the Michigan Inter-governmental Trade Network. If you are a vendor,
you can register on MITN and get access to the bids, RFP's, quotes, 
addenda and awards posted by agencies on the system.

Please provide the following records:

1. Please provide a copy of the winning bid documents for the 2012 project 
“Arbopolis Cascadia”, contract ITB-5555, awarded to Riparian Contractors Inc.

2. Please provide a copy of each of the bid documents for bidders for 
“Arbopolis Cascadia” that did not win the contract.
~~~~~~~~

## Budgets and expenditures

Annual budgets, and documents created during the budget planning
process, should be available via a records request. These can
pinpoint areas of spending that deserve further inquiry and scrutiny
as well as providing the organization that looks to do business
with the government some guidelines for anticipated expenses.

The actual expense records of a government, such as checks written,
purchasing card logs, and expense reports from individuals are
public records subject to FOIA. By following the money, you can
trace patterns of approved and discretionary expenses and see where
your tax money is going.

Doing a search for expenses may not be an easy one, especially if
your sense for how expenses are categorized differs from the
government’s accounting methods.  To tally up all of the expenses
associated with the upkeep of one high-spending Ohio university
president, a newspaper in that state spent a year combing through
executive calendars, credit card statements, discretionary spending
reports, employment contracts and invoices to come up with a total
figure that accounted for expenses across multiple budget categories.

Note that some governments have expense and budget records online.
Before putting together a complex FOIA request, inquire as to whether
there is an interactive online “open checkbook” available to the
public to prepare direct queries.

If you were going to look for one document first before anything else,
it would be the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (better known as
CAFR). This report, which can run into the hundreds of pages, provides
a consolidated view of the finances of a public body. In many cases,
a version of this will be online.

{lang=text}
~~~~~~~~
Please provide the following records:

1. A copy of the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for Pine Stump
Township for the immediately previous fiscal year.
~~~~~~~~

If you are requesting financial records, be prepared for some parts of
the record like account numbers to be redacted. Be sure to appeal if
you get rejected for "personal privacy" reasons; public expenditures
are subject to public scrutiny.

## Building inspection records, building permits and assessor’s records

Government bodies that deal with property inspections and assessment
compile records which can be valuable to a potential purchaser of
housing or land. You can determine when major construction work was
done that required permits, obtain photographs of a parcel over
time, and note any relevant history of inspections for rental
property.

In some cases an online service will have some or all of the details
that you are after, allowing you to avoid a FOIA request. For
property records, be sure to check both at the city or township
level and at the county level, as records may be held in multiple
locations.  Online permitting systems that give some details of a
permit such as a date or permit number can be used to speed up a
request for the full permit details.

Sample request:

{lang=text}
~~~~~~~~
Please provide the following records:

1. All permits issued for construction from January 1, 2000 to date,
for the property at 100 Duck Duck Lane, Arbopolis.

~~~~~~~~

## Contracts between governments and their lobbying organizations

Some public bodies engage with lobbying firms to help them get information
about the workings of other public bodies and to help promote their agenda.
If you are interested in the relationships among government bodies, and
the legislative agenda that your local officials are pursuing, contracts
and communications with lobbyists are a good place to start.

Sample request

{lang=text}
~~~~~~~~

Please provide the following records:

1. The contract between the City of Arbopolis and Government Success
Now Inc., for the latest fiscal year.

2. Records of any work product produced by Government Success Now Inc
for the City of Arbopolis from January 1, 2013 to date.

## Criminal histories

OTIS (the Offender Tracking and Information System) is ... XXX

ICHAT (the Internet Criminal History Access Tool) is ... XXX

## Dog licenses

Animal licenses are public records, and can be requested via FOIA.
Depending on the location, these may be held by the city or township,
or by the county. 

{lang=text}
~~~~~~~~

Please provide the following records:

1. All records of dog licenses for animals residing on Duck Duck Lane.

~~~~~~~~

## Electronic mail as records

Electronic mail sent by government employees as a part of their
work is considered to be public records and is subject to FOIA.
There are exemptions which are applied unevenly by various FOIA
officers related to the “personal privacy exemption”, which may
result in part or all of the email being redacted or withheld from
the FOIA response.  In addition, there are exceptions for messages
that are part of a “deliberative process”, which is designed to
allow frank discussion of alternatives prior to a final decision
being made.

FOIA requests for email are some of the most controversial and
expensive requests that you can prepare, and you should be prepared
for delays when fulfilling a request that includes email as a part
of your request. To minimize costs and delays, be specific in what
you are looking for, define the dates and times that are relevant
narrowly, and identify if possible the identities of the senders
and recipients for the messages.

Sample request

{lang=text}
~~~~~~~~
1. Records associated with the inspection of the sidewalk in front
of 1 Shady Lane from 2009 to date.

2. Electronic mail associated with the inspection of this sidewalk,
including but not limited to those messages sent to and from members
of the Building Department and the Sidewalk Inspection Board in
October and November 2011.
~~~~~~~~

## Fire department records

If you know or suspect that a property has had damage due to a fire,
you can obtain those records and see what is known about that damage.
For fastest service, specify in as much detail as you have the
location and date of the fire.

There are a variety of standard reports used by fire departments to
provide information for insurance companies and the like.

{lang=text}
~~~~~~~~

Please provide the following records:

1. The NFIRS basic incident report for a fire at 10 Goosedown Court
on January 11, 2012.
2. The investigation report for this fire.
3. Any photographs of this fire. Please provide these in digital form.
4. Any environmental reports from this fire.

~~~~~~~~

## Official calendars

The official calendar of a government official, showing how and
where they have spent their days and weeks, is a public record and
is subject to FOIA.

Asking for a calendar is at least as touchy a query as asking to look
through the electronic mail, so be prepared to put the request in 
writing and to wait the maximum allotted time.

{lang=text}
~~~~~~~~

Please provide the following records:

1. The official calendar for Mayor John Avis for the month of April 2013.

~~~~~~~~

## Police records

Recordings of 911 calls, in-car audio and video recorded by police, and
official records of police investigations are all public records, and
may be requested via FOIA.

Note that there are several exemptions provided by the law to restrict
access to police investigative records. If a case is still open, records
are exempt from disclosure.

Generally there is a designated Public Information Officer in each 
police department of any size. If your work takes you to needing
police records in any quantity, a good working relationship with that
individual is key to getting information promptly.

## Policies and procedures

Beyond the laws of the land there are a series of administrative
policies and procedures that are written by government administrators
to guide behavior. If you find yourself confused by the workings
of governance, a request for policy and procedures manuals may
enlighten you and help shed light on how things get done.

In general, well-formed requests for policy and procedure documents
should be straightforward to answer. In your request, you are not
obligated to say why you are looking for the information. Don’t
start with a tirade or rant about unfair treatment; rather, make
your request plain, simple, and direct.

## Potholes

If your vehicle was damaged by a pothole, you might be able to
get compensation from the public body reponsible for maintaining
the road. A public records request demonstrating reports that the public
body knew about the pothole in advance allowed an Ann Arbor man to
successfully settle with the City of Ann Arbor. XXX
