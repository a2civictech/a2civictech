# Michigan FOIA Guide draft
## The Michigan Freedom of Information Act: A No-Nonsense Guide
## Edward Vielmetti 

# Foreword

The Michigan Freedom of Information Act, and its companion the Michigan Open Meetings Act, 
were passed in 1976 in the wake of the Watergate scandal,
led by the efforts of the late Rep. Perry Bullard. 
The laws provide citizens with the right 
to examine and view the workings of their government and to examine records that it produces. 

This guide was written in 2012 and 2013 and is based 
in part on a series of articles written for 
AnnArbor.com during 2010 and 2011. It illustrates in plain language how and why you might 
use FOIA laws to obtain government documents. The guide should be useful for people involved 
in the political process, as well as for businesses that work or want to work on government 
contracts. From fixing a broken sidewalk to obtaining a crime report, the Michigan Freedom 
of Information Act is a versatile tool to ensure that you are not ignored when it’s your 
turn to deal with City Hall.

Chapter 1 introduces with Michigan Freedom of Information Act with a sample FOIA request, 
illustrating the basic elements of such a request. Chapter 2 follows with a list of the 
types of information that you might be interested in getting through the FOIA process. 
Chapter 3 addresses fees for FOIA requests and makes practical suggestions on how to minimize 
your costs. Chapter 4 looks at how to make your FOIA request go through the system quickly, 
and looks at delays in the process that you can avoid.

Not every FOIA request is successful on the first try, and it’s important in your use 
of the FOIA process to know how to appeal a rejected request. Chapter 5 looks at exemptions 
written into the Michigan FOIA laws that allow a government to refuse to provide records 
that it holds. Chapter 6 discusses the appeals process, and provides a sample FOIA appeal 
for a rejected request. Chapter 7 looks at how you can rewrite a rejected request to get 
a positive answer for a modification of your original request, and Chapter 8 looks at 
some cases where organizations have gone to court to pursue their appeals through the judicial system.

Closely related to the Michigan FOIA laws is the Michigan Open Meetings Act, which ensures 
that meetings of public bodies are conducted in public. Chapter 9 looks at the practical 
aspects of open meetings laws, and Chapter 10 looks at remedies that you can pursue if 
you believe that a meeting has been held out of the public eye.

# Chapter 1: A sample FOIA request


[Preamble]


Michigan FOIA laws do not specify a particular format that a request must be provided in. 
As long as a request for records is provided in writing, it should be handled by the 
government body as a FOIA request and passed along to the individual who coordinates 
FOIA responses. In practice, it is always best to contact the body that you are requesting 
records from and identify who the request should be addressed to. You may find that the 
city clerk, city attorney’s office, communications office, or township supervisor is 
ultimately in charge of FOIA requests. If there is any question, contact the office 
of the highest ranking official and ask to whom a FOIA request should be addressed.

FOIA requests in Michigan must be made in writing. A verbal request for records is 
not considered a FOIA request, and the laws that ensure a timely response do not apply 
to verbal requests. If you really want to find something out through this process, you 
must write down your question.

Governments are not obliged to create new records in response to a FOIA request, and you 
should not expect that broad requests for information will be answered the way that 
you expect. Instead, seek out existing records (paper or electronic) that will help 
you determine the information you want. You may discover in the course of getting an
answer to your first query that a second query is necessary; if so, repeat the process
until you're satisfied.

Make in plainly clear in your request letter that you are making a request under the act. 
You may get faster response via electronic mail if your Subject line also includes the 
word FOIA. Beware that some agencies with overly aggressive spam filtering on email may
divert your message into their spam mailbox; it's always appropriate to follow up an email
with a subsequent "did you get my message" phone call if a timely answer is required.

Get straight to the point in your request for records, and do not fill your request 
letter with polemics, anger, invective, or other extraneous rhetoric. Keep the request 
letter as simple as possible, to ensure that it is handled as a matter of routine and 
so that the clerk is not distracted by a stray argument. 

Be pleasant and direct, especially in person.

If you are asking for more than one thing, number your requests.

To save duplication costs, ask for your records in electronic format. This not only 
saves paper but can dramatically reduce the cost of fulfilling the request.

If you expect that some of the records that you request will be redacted, e.g. for 
personal privacy reasons, specify that the agency should separate out the parts of 
the request that it can fulfill from those that it won’t to ensure that you 
get as much information as you can.

Set a maximum amount that you are willing to pay for your request, and do not 
agree to have the agency do the work for any more than that maximum unless you 
give a specific go-ahead. There may be something that you asked for that you 
thought should be easy to provide that turns out to be expensive, and you want 
to leave room for negotiation.

Always ask for a waiver of fees in the case where anything you do will be shared 
with the public. Michigan FOIA law provides for discretion by the public body 
whether or not to assess a fee, and many organizations provide responses for free 
when the time spent compiling a response is small enough to be considered routine, 
e.g. less than an hour of a clerk’s time. (See more on fees in Chapter 3.)

# Chapter 2: Records available via FOIA requests

There is a wide variety of records held by most Michigan government bodies that 
can be retrieved through the FOIA process. Here is a list of some of these, with 
suggestions for how you might phrase a request for records to maximize the chance 
that you’ll get what you are looking for with a minimum of costs as quickly as possible.

## Bids and contracts

If you are doing business with a government, you should know that the bids and 
contracts associated with awards are a matter of public record. By making records 
requests for the bids of competing organizations you can obtain details that may 
be helpful in preparing your next bid or proposal.

Note that bids are exempt from disclosure until the contract has been awarded.

For fastest service, provide as much information about the bidding process as you can 
locate, including contract numbers, full names of winning or losing bidders, and exact 
or approximate dates. You’ll almost certainly want to ask for documents in electronic 
format if possible to save reproduction costs.

Sample request:

1. Please provide a copy of the winning bid documents for the 2012 project 
“Arbopolis Cascadia”, contract ITB-5555, awarded to Riparian Contractors Inc.

2. Please provide a copy of each of the bid documents for bidders for 
“Arbopolis Cascadia” that did not win the contract.

## Budgets and expenditures

Annual budgets, and documents created during the budget planning process, should be 
available via a records request. These can pinpoint areas of spending that deserve 
further inquiry and scrutiny as well as providing the organization that looks to do
business with the government some guidelines for anticipated expenses.

The actual expense records of a government, such as checks written, purchasing card 
logs, and expense reports from individuals are public records subject to FOIA. By 
following the money, you can trace patterns of approved and discretionary expenses 
and see where your tax money is going.

Doing a search for expenses may not be an easy one, especially if your sense for how 
expenses are categorized differs from the government’s accounting methods. 
To tally up all of the expenses associated with the upkeep of one high-spending 
Ohio university president, a newspaper in that state spent a year combing through 
executive calendars, credit card statements, discretionary spending reports, employment 
contracts and invoices to come up with a total figure that accounted for expenses across
multiple budget categories.

Note that some governments have expense and budget records online. Before putting 
together a complex FOIA request, inquire as to whether there is an interactive online 
“open checkbook” available to the public to prepare direct queries.

## Policies and procedures

Beyond the laws of the land there are a series of administrative policies and procedures 
that are written by government administrators to guide behavior. If you find yourself 
confused by the workings of governance, a request for policy and procedures manuals 
may enlighten you and help shed light on how things get done. 

In general, well-formed requests for policy and procedure documents should be 
straightforward to answer. In your request, you are not obligated to say why you are 
looking for the information. Don’t start with a tirade or rant about unfair treatment; 
rather, make your request plain, simple, and direct.

## Building inspection records, building permits and assessor’s records

Government bodies that deal with property inspections and assessment compile 
records which can be valuable to a potential purchaser of housing or land. You can 
determine when major construction work was done that required permits, obtain 
photographs of a parcel over time, and note any relevant history of 
inspections for rental property.

In some cases an online service will have some or all of the details that you are after, 
allowing you to avoid a FOIA request. For property records, be sure to check 
both at the city or township level and at the county level, 
as records may be held in multiple locations. 
Online permitting systems that give some details of a permit such as a date or permit number 
can be used to speed up a request for the full permit details.

### Sample request:

1. Please provide a copy of rental inspection records for the property at 1 Shady Lane, Arbopolis MI, for the period of 2005 to date.
2. Please provide a copy of all records related to permit PLUMB-1109 for 1 Shady Lane, issued in March 2011.

## Fire department records

If you know or suspect that a property has had damage due to a fire, you can obtain those 
records and see what is known about that damage. For fastest service, specify in as much 
detail as you have the location and date of the fire.

## Electronic mail as records

Electronic mail sent by government employees as a part of their work is considered to 
be public records and is subject to FOIA. There are exemptions which are applied unevenly by 
various FOIA officers related to the “personal privacy exemption”, which may result in part 
or all of the email being redacted or withheld from the FOIA response. 
In addition, there are exceptions for messages that are part of a “deliberative process”, 
which is designed to allow frank discussion of alternatives prior to a final decision being made.

FOIA requests for email are some of the most controversial and expensive requests that you 
can prepare, and you should be prepared for delays when fulfilling a request that includes 
email as a part of your request. To minimize costs and delays, be specific in what you are looking for, 
define the dates and times that are relevant narrowly, 
and identify if possible the identities of the senders and recipients for the messages. 

### Sample request:

1. Records associated with the inspection of the sidewalk in front of 1 Shady Lane from 2009 to date.
2. Electronic mail associated with the inspection of this sidewalk, including but not limited to those messages sent to and from members of the Building Department and the Sidewalk Inspection Board in October and November 2011.

= Chapter 4: Speeding the process along, and avoiding delays

= Chapter 5. Exemptions to disclosure.

Michigan FOIA law has a set of exemptions [MCL 15.243] which allow a government body to refuse to release records that they hold. This chapter makes a study of each of them, with suggestions on how to reframe your request to obtain the maximum information available.


The law provides exceptions lettered (a) through (y), ranging from personal privacy to national security with lots of stops in between. In some cases, the exemptions are mandatory for the agency; in other cases there’s considerable discretion.


Personal privacy (a)


The law provides for an exemption for “information of a personal nature if public disclosure of the information would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of an individual's privacy.” A similar provision for law enforcement records is labelled (b)(3).


Some agencies routinely redact personally identifiable contact information for citizens who are named in public records requests, such as electronic mail addresses, telephone numbers, and postal addresses. In many cases, the requester can re-identify the redacted information by consulting other databases such as telephone books or assessment records.


In other cases, agencies have redacted information about government employees, such as the names of individuals on purchasing records. A successful appeal caused this to be overruled, with the argument that the need for oversight of government spending outweighed any privacy interest involved.


Note that some government employee contracts spell out cases in which the body that employs them agrees to notify the employee before personal information about them is released to the world. If you face this situation, be prepared for the request to not only come back with the maximum possible redactions, but also for it to take the longest amount of time.


Some government employees conduct incidental personal business through their work email account. Your mayor’s electronic mail message with birthday greetings to her mom is not necessarily a public record subject to disclosure. If, on the other hand, your mayor was running a substantial side business from their mayoral email account, you could and should make the argument that any personal privacy interest was balanced by the public interest in accounting for proper use of government resources. 


If your request has bits of it blacked out because of the personal privacy exemption and you decide to appeal, you’ll need to provide justification in your request. Spell out the reasons why you think the information should be released, making the argument that the release of the information is primarily to illustrate the workings of government and that the privacy interest in obscuring personal details is outweighed by the public interest.
