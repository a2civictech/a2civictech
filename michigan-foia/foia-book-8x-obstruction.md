# Chapter 8x: How to obstruct a FOIA request

There are many reasons why a public body or its members
might want to be less than speedy and less than forthcoming
in providing public records. Think of this chapter as a
manual for how to slow down the FOIA process, by making
as difficult as possible within the bounds of the law to
get information out of a public body.

"[O]utdated FOIA regulations, excessive fee assessments, growing FOIA
backlogs, and the misuse of exemptions are issues that continually
frustrate FOIA requesters" EPIC

## Don't encourage FOIA requests 

Don't provide any information about FOIA on your web site.

Don't accept FOIA requests by electronic mail.

Take FOIA requests by email, but route them to a mailbox that
is not opened regularly.

Route FOIA requests to SPAM.

Assign limited hours to the FOIA coordinator.

## Require signed, notarized proof of identity

Ask for ID.

Ask for a signed, notarized affadavit of intent (Saugatuck)

Require that a citizen go through a security checkpoint to hand in a request.

## You'll have to FOIA that

Don't give up documents without going through FOIA.

Insist that requests for information be put in writing, and then reject
those requests since FOIA only requires that records, not information,
be returned.

## Exercise all possible delays

Always require an extension whenever possible. This extends the minimum
time for a FOIA request to three work weeks.

Return all records at the very end of the time allowed, even if you
have them ready ahead of time.

## Maximize fees

Anticipate costs, and estimate high. There's nothing like a second
round of legal review on redactions to keep costs high.

Charge the maximum possible for photocopying, like the Washtenaw
County Trial Court which charges $2 per page. Charge an additional
fee for the time spent by staff to make the photocopies.

Require a deposit in every possible case. Your goal is to make even
routine requests cost more than $50.00 to fulfill.

Stop work on a FOIA request until you get paid. This is especially
valuable in the case where you can estimate costs so high that the
requester is unlikely to pay them.

When charging for labor costs, also charge for fringe benefits and
overhead costs. Require that all FOIA requests are reviewed by 
legal staff and not clerical staff to maximize costs.

Require a certified check for fees, to slow things down just a little
more and make them a bit more cumbersome.

## Store your records badly

Use an arcane computer system to store records, one that requires
high paid IT staff to run reports rather than low paid clerical staff.

Use a complicated and poorly understood system for electronic records
search for electronic mail, thus ensuring both that irrelevant records
are returned to inflate the cost as well as relevant records being
missed inadvertently.

Avoid standards when coding complaints, so that dog barking complaints
are stored multiple ways.

## Use paper liberally

Charge per page, but don't use both sides of the page; or, if you do
use both sides of a page, charge for each page image separately.

Use an old dot matrix printer or a bad photocopier for your public
records responses, to make the results hardest to read. The New York
Police Department used a blurry photocopier to respond to a request
from Muckrock News, resulting in documents that were illegible; Muckrock
appealed and eventually got clean copies.

## Take advantage of public-private partnerships

## Deny records liberally

Every record should get maximum scrutinty looking for ways to deny access.
If any reason can be found for denying the record, use it aggressively.

### Absurdly overbroad

### Attorney-client privelege

Get your legal staff involved in document review and preparation. Better
yet, outsource your legal 

### Deliberative process

### Safety or security of persons and property (1)(y)

## Avoid punitive damages

Exercise the law and these delays equally among all requesters, so that
you aren't seen as "arbitrary and capricious" when you're hauled in to court.
