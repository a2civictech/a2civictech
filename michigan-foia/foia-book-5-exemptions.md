# Chapter 5: FOIA exemptions

Not every type of record held by a public body is considered a public 
record, and not every public record is required to be disclosed under
the Michigan FOIA laws. You will typically find that any FOIA request
for moderately complex documents, espeically electronic mail, will be
subject to one or more FOIA exemptions. In this case you will either
be provided with a brief annotation of which records were omitted from
your request, or a blacked out (or "redacted") copy of the original
with the offending text omitted from view.

Michigan state law incorporates exemptions from disclosure in two ways.
There are (as of 2013) exemptions (a) thorugh (y) which detail materials
exempt from disclosure directly in the Michigan FOIA law. In addition,
a number of other laws specifically exempt classes of records from
disclosure, and there are court cases that interpret the law and 
provide nuances of interpretation where the laws are not clear.

Because of this complexity, this list of exemptions covers
the more popular reasons you might not get back what you want, but
doesn't start to enumerate all of the possible reasons you might get
rejected.

Chapter 6 looks at the appeals process. If you have been turned down in
part because of an exemption, you can challenge the public body to
review that exemption and convince them that their initial determination
was inaccurate.

MCL 15.243 provides a list of exemptions from disclosure; they are
listed here in alphabetical order by common name, with notes to the
subsection of the law that applies. References to subsections
are noted here.

## Absentee ballots

Records of who has requested an absentee ballot and who has returned one
are routinely provided to the public upon request, though the actual
details of how someone has voted are exempt from disclosure.

## Absurdly overbroad and burdensome requests

The courts have ruled that requests that would return an unreasonable
amount of records can be rejected by the agency. Consider a request
for every electronic mail message sent or received by an agency over
the past year. The sheer volume of records to be returned, plus the
cost of redacting all of them to protect individual privacy and to
comply with all other exemptions, is sufficiently great as to allow
the agency to reject the request as "absurdly overbroad".

If your request is rejected for this or a related reason, you probably
didn't narrow down your request to something that could actually be
done by the public body.

## Appraisals of real property 13(1)(j)

If a public body is contemplating purchasing a piece of property,
they will conduct an appraisal of that parcel to find a fair market
value. This appraisal will be kept from the public eye until after
the transaction has completed, or until 3 years after the original
appraisal was complete.

## Attorney-client privilege 13(1)(g)

Communications between a public body and their legal counsel are
protected from disclosure.  This is a fundamental exemption and is
common in state and Federal FOIA laws.

To illustrate, consider that the City of Arbopolis is suing Studio 9, Inc.
for operating an illegal nightclub. Studio 9 cannot use the FOIA law to
ask for copies of the city's lawsuit plans.

Michigan law provides a four-point test to determine whether a
communication is covered under this point: is the communication
written; is the communication made in confidence between attorney
and client; is the attorney acting as legal advisor; and is the
communication for the purpose of seeking advice on some obligation
or right.

Note that it is very common for communications created by attorneys
to be exempted from disclosure, especially when those same attorneys
are responsible for administering some or all of the FOIA process.

## Bids and proposals 13(1)(i)

Until a bid has been awarded, the details of the proposals for that
bid are kept in confidence until the bids are opened.

Once the bids have been opened, the proposals are public records,
and are subject to disclosure.

## Copyrighted materials

In some cases, copyrighted information will be released via a FOIA
request. A Michigan Attorney General's opinion states that copyrighted
materials are exempt from disclosure except as governed by the Federal
Copyright Act. In practice, it is not surprising to see copyrighted
news articles distributed in FOIA responses, or to see other incidental
duplication of copyrighted materials.

The Confidential Research and Investment Information Act [Act 55 of 1994,
MCL 390.1551] provides additional exemptions for public universities,
allowing confidential research to be exempted from FOIA. If you are
regularly looking for records from Michigan's public universities,
be prepared to see that exemption.

## Deliberative process 13(1)(m)

In the course of making decisions about policy, government officials
discuss multiple possible policy paths. This act of deliberation is
actively protected under Michigan law (and many other state FOIA laws),
with an exemption known as the "deliberative process" exemption, covering
"communications of an advisory nature".

To illustrate, consider communications between the mayor of Arbopolis
and the mayor of the adjoining town of Bentham Springs about plans for
bus service between the two cities. An opponent of public transit could
not use a FOIA request to intercept these deliberations while they
are occuring. This is designed to allow "frank and open" discussions
to happen prior to decision making, and not subject the parties to
intrusive queries while they are trying to sort out a course of action.

The exemption only covers the opinions and discussions among officials,
and not the facts that they are discussing. This means that if the
deliberative process exemption is invoked, there still might be some
parts of the records released, with the deliberations redacted and the
facts left whole.

## Educational records (FERPA)

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act [34 CFR Part 99] is a
Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records.
In general, schools may release "directory" information such as a
student's name, address, telephone number, and honors or awards, but
students have a right to opt out of this release. Other student
information such as grades, student work products, and similar records
of education are exempt from disclosure under Federal law.

In practice, if you are asking for any information about students
from a public university, you are likely to bump up against FERPA
at some point.

## Governor's office

The Governor of the State of Michigan, and all of the Governor's
offices, are exempt from FOIA requests.

## Judiciary

The judicial branch of the State of Michigan is exempt from FOIA.

## Law enforcement communication codes 13(1)(n)

10-4 good buddy! A directory of codes used by law enforcement to
communicate, e.g. over an open radio channel, need not be disclosed
to the public. In practice, many such codes are in commmon use among
multiple departments, and avid scanner listeners have recreated
those codes in part to assist in their monitoring of public service
communications.

## Law enforcement investigating records 13(1)(b)

Law enforcement investigating records are public records and are
subject to disclosure. The caveat is that there are multiple
exemptions that allow a law enforcement agency to withhold release
of records.

1. If release of records would "interfere with law enforcement proceedings",
the records may be withheld. This is a very broad exemption and leaves
a lot to the discretion of the agency.
2. If release of records would "deprive a person of a right to a fair trial",
they are exempt from disclosure. This is often used to minimize publicity
about a case before it goes to trial.
3. If release of records would be an "unwarranted invasion of
personal privacy", they are exempt. 
4. Records that would "disclose the identity of a confidential source"
are exempt. 

## Medical records 13(1)(l)

"Protected health information"

## Personal privacy 13(1)(a)

Some government employees conduct incidental personal business
through their work email account. Your mayorâ€™s electronic mail
message with birthday greetings to her mom is not necessarily a
public record subject to disclosure. If, on the other hand, your
mayor was running a substantial side business from their mayoral
email account, you could and should make the argument that any
personal privacy interest was balanced by the public interest in
accounting for proper use of government resources.

The personal privacy exemption is a discretionary exemption, and
it's not necessary for an agency to redact personal information.
This will mean that in some cases your request will turn up names,
addresses, and phone numbers or email addresses of non-government
officials who may be further sources for your research.

An example of where personal privacy and the desire for transparent
government collide is in the handling of recordings of 911 calls.
It is not unusual for the media to report based on recordings of 
911 calls obtained from police dispatch, and some of those recordings
contain intimate personal details. A 2013 bill in Michigan would
exempt those calls from disclosure; as of this writing it has not
passed. (Similar legislation to restrict access to 911 information
has been seen in Georgia.)

Some government employees conduct substantial amounts of
official business using personal email accounts. These messages
are still public records, subject to disclosure.

## Security exemptions 13(1)(y)

After September 11, 2001, public bodies around the country began to
examine national security exceptions to FOIA laws.

In Michigan, these include [MCL XXX(y)], which exempts a wide variety
of critical infrastructure information, including but not limited to
details of dams, gas pipelines, and [XXX].

## Test questions 13(1)(k)

Answers to test questions are exempt from FOIA. You can't request the
answers to the state licensing examinations and get an unfair advantage.

## Trade secrets 13(1)(f)

If an company has submitted a trade secret to a Michigan government
unit, e.g. in the course of making a bid or proposal, you might not
be able to get a copy of it. Michigan law allows the 
company to mark that portion of their document ask a trade secret,
and to exempt it from disclosures. What you would get instead is
a redacted copy of the document, plus a summary of the nature of
the redacted information.
