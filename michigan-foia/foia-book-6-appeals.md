# Chapter 6: Appealing your FOIA rejection

The first time your FOIA request comes back with a full or partial
denial, it can be discouraging. You went to all of the trouble to
make a reasonable request, and for some reason that you don't yet
understand the answer was no. Many people give up at this point.

There's no need to give up on your Freedom of Information Act request
if you get an initial denial. In Michigan, you are guaranteed a review
on appeal by the administrative head of the organization that you
were rejected by, and you have time to compose yourself to get 
some advice on how to construct an appeal. Appeal rules in other
states vary, with some having a central state-level governmental
body as part of the process.

Everything is negotiable in a FOIA request, especially if you can
make your point carefully, clearly, politely, and without undue
drama. You can appeal delays, redactions, fees, and even the formats
in which your reply will be provided. Your no-nonsense approach to
dealing with clerks, administrators, and bureaucrats should emphasize
the precise records you are seeking, and the plausible reasons under
the law and good sense that they should give them to you promptly
and at a reasonable cost.

## Deadlines for your appeal

The Michigan FOIA law allows 180 days from the rejection of your
request for you to appeal it. This is unusually long compared to
other states.

If the deadline has passed, you still have recourse. Reframing your
denied request into a new request that has a goal to get similar
records back is perfectly OK, and in fact may be better if you get
an outright denial.

## Making an informal appeal in person

Before you make a formal appeal in writing, it may be worthwhile to
make an appeal in person or over the phone to the head of the organization.
Depending on the request, there may be quite a bit of discretion that
the organization's leader has in getting you an answer.

If you can't find a mayor, city administrator, or department head
to consult, seek redress through an elected official. Your city
council person, state representative, congressman, or senator's
office may be able to get the materials you are looking for without
resorting to official, formal, and slow channels.

## Making your appeal in writing

A written appeal gives the agency another chance to review your request.
As you write it, carefully consider the reasons why your request was
denied, and construct your appeal to counter those objections. There
is sample text below that can be used to work out these objections.

## Deliberative process: separating exempt from non-exempt materials

If you get a blanket rejection because the materials are under a
"deliberative process" exemption, ask that the agency separate out
the exempt materials from the non-exempt materials. 

The rationale that you can give is that while the discussions of
why a particular policy should or should not be implemented are
exempt, there is still strictly factual material embedded in that
collection of records. If you are successful, you'll get back a
partial set of records, with just the facts disclosed and the
discussion about what policy course to take redacted.

## Negotiating personal privacy rejections

There is a great deal of discretion in what a given jurisdiction will
do with the Michigan FOIA's "personal privacy" exemption. In some
cases, the Sharpie will be wielded with a heavy hand, wiping out
telephone numbers, email addresses, and even names of citizens
who have contacted the agency. Privacy advocates will welcome this
approach, though it will only slow down and not stop the determined
reader in seeking out alternative sources for the redacted information.

More insidious is the use of a personal privacy exemption to
block access to the actions of individual government employees
in the course of their official business. In one instance, a
municipality initially rejected disclosing information about
purchasing card records, arguing that these were personal records.
A successful appeal pointed out that the sum of these individual
purchases done by individuals in the course of their jobs added
up to hundreds of thousands of dollars, and that was sufficient
to warrant release of the information.

The Michigan law refers to an "unwarranted" intrusion into personal
privacy. Your appeal may be more successful if you have a rationale
for this request, rather than simply asserting your rights to the
materials.

## Attorney-client privilege

Materials which are prepared for a public body by its legal counsel
are exempt from disclosure. This is a fundamental exemption in the law,
and extends beyond the FOIA laws to all matter of instances where
those communications are protected.

In the case of these materials, you are likely to get rejected at
first request. In your appeal language, you should remind the public
body that the client (the public body) has the right to waive
attorney-client privilege by disclosing materials.

There is not a lot of case law to draw from to draw the determination
of who in a public body is allowed to make the decision to release
materials that are protected by this privilege. In corporate law,
the right to release materials is generally given to the management
in control of the corporation. Your appeal should be directed, as
ever, to the official at the public body who is the highest ranking,
or to the governing board of the body.

## Reducing costs

Everything is negotiable in a FOIA request, including the cost of the
materials that you wish to get. An agency may charge a reasonable copying
fee and for the time of individuals spent working on the request, but
they don't have to.

The key to reducing costs is to make sure that the agency does not
spend lots and lots of time and money fulfilling a request that you
are unwilling to pay for. This is the motivation behind the "stop loss"
clause that you should insert into every request, reading something
like this:

{lang=text}
~~~~~~~~

I am willing to pay up to $10 for this request, and if the projected
cost is more than $10, please provide a detailed estimate of charges.

~~~~~~~~

If you have done this up front, then you can protect yourself from
the worries of getting an unexpectedly large and impossible to pay
bill. Your stop on excessive charges will give you time to negotiate
with the clerk or administrator to find an economical way to get the
records you wish.

## Appealing at the state level before you go to court

Current (2014) Michigan law does not provide for any state-wide body
to review FOIA cases before they go into the court system. If you have
exhausted your appeals at the local level, your only next step is to
bring a lawsuit.

Some other states, including Illinois, have statewide appeals bodies.

There is a bill in the Michigan House (HB 4314 of 2013) which would
create an "Open Government Commission" which would allow appeals to
go to a statewide body under the Department of Civil Rights.
