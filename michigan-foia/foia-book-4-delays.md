# Chapter 4: Avoiding FOIA delays

If you are making a request under the Michigan Freedom of Information
Act, there is a timetable that agencies must follow in responding
to your request. The entire process can seem lengthy, especially when
you are in a hurry.

Here are some methods for speeding up your request, so that you get
the maximum amount of useful information in the minimum amount of time.
To make any of this work it's helpful to have some basic tools at
your disposal - a calendar, to mark when you've sent documents, 
a reminder system to give you alerts when deadlines are due, and
a spreadsheet or database to track progress towards your goal.

The basic timetable for getting a reply through FOIA is defined in
[MCL 15.235, 15.240].
* 5 business days for an initial response
* 10 business days for an extension
* 10 business days for a response to an appeal
* 10 additional business days for an extension in "unusual circumstances"

The whole process can grind along for 35 business days in
unusual circumstances, and that's before you get to court.

## Avoid FOIA

Civic officials will often be cooperative in providing documents,
especially to those who are pleasant, accomodating, and know what
they are looking for. You may go through a mayor, a city administrator,
or a city clerk, and sometimes the heads of various departments
are accessible enough to approach directly with a question and a 
verbal request.

One of the questions you'll inevitably get when you ask for information
or public records with a verbal request is the question of why you
are looking for the information. Michigan FOIA law is explicit that
no reason is necessary when making a written request, but if you are
seeking informal cooperation, you may find it helpful to disclose just
enough of your story to elicit a friendly response.

Remember, only written requests are FOIA requests. If an official says
to you "you'll need to FOIA that", be prepared to take them up promptly
on their offer. A simple handwritten FOIA letter, delivered on the spot
to a recalcitrant public official who insists upon the written process,
may be an effective theater to prove your point about some aspect of
local government transparency.

## Be nice

There is a lot of discretion in the handling of paperwork in a typical
municipal office. If your query is full of angry bluster, it is likely
to go at the bottom of the pile until someone can sort it out. 
On the other hand, if you have already worked with clerks to formulate
efficient requests and can let them know that what you want should
not take very long to respond, you may well be able to get back results
in less time than the maximum.

It always pays to be pleasant, especially when you are looking to 
find documents that are of practical use. Well-behaved requesters,
with sternly worded but straightforward request letters, will inevitably
find that they are treated with more fairness and caution than those
who mix their grievance with the organization in with their request
for records from it.

If it's your first time writing a FOIA request, please use an existing
template for your request, either the one provided in this book in 
Chapter 1 or one of the FOIA letter generators mentioned in Appendix A.
Comfortable and understandable boilerplate language will get you an
answer more quickly than when your questions are mixed in with language
expressing frustration or rage.

## Type legibly

In some cases you will be presented with a FOIA form to fill out. If it is
necessary because of peculiar circumstances to use the paperwork of the
office rather than writing your own letter, produce a document that is
legible. Handwritten, hurried scrawl may be rejected as illegible.

If you are fortunate the preprinted form from a public body will be
a PDF document that can be edited, so that you can type in the request
and have it be easy to read.

In general, it's a better idea to draft your own letter than it is to
use an existing form. If nothing else, the letter you send that you
wrote yourself will be legible and you won't need to scrunch a
hand-written request into the too-small space provided on most forms.

## Impress upon the clerk the urgency of your request

If you are working on a deadline, make sure that the person handling
your request is aware of it. They may be able to shuffle their workload
around to accomodate you ahead of others. This is especially the case
when you've taken great care to be pleasant, courteous, cheerful, and
polite as well.

## Remind the public body if the request is delayed

In some cases, the public body will fail to meet a deadline. You shouldn't
let things slide. Put the dates where you are expecting a response into
your calendar. If you are managing a lot of queries, use a spreadsheet
or some other database to track progress and schedule follow ups.

In Michigan, non-response to a FOIA request within the allotted time is
considered a rejection, and you are entitled to appeal that rejection.
Chapter 6 provides rationale and some appeal text that you can use in
that case.

The MuckRock service, described in Appendix A, has a service which will
automatically send nagging letters to public bodies who are tardy in their
responses. You may find them especially helpful in making Federal FOIA
requests, where delays are a matter of routine rather than exception.

You might find that there is more to be gained with a phone call or
in-person meeting to check on delays, rather than relying solely on
written correspondence. This can be a way to find out whether staff are
busy with an election or out on vacation, or whether they are overtly
defensive or hostile to your request. As always, a good temper and
patience are helpful in not triggering extra delays.

## Make a smaller request, rather than a larger one

If time is of the essence in your request, make a request that is smaller
than what you eventually expect to get. Your narrowly scoped request
will be easier to fulfill and may lead you to information that improves
your follow on request for more wide ranging records.

## Seek records that have already been published

The easiest way to get a FOIA request filled immediately is to make
it unnecessary because you have found documents that have already
made it to the agency's web site. Government web sites can be tricky
to navigate, so it might take some digging or some help from a
public information officer or public relations contact.

## Ask for specific documents by their distinguished name

If you are able to do some research before making your request, you
may be able to find out precisely the name of the document or report
that you are searching for by the name it is known within the organization.
What one organization calls a "plumbing permit" is known by some 
other organization as a "form 27B-6", and knowing the precise form
name will aid in records retrieval.

## Do not use FOIA as a means of abuse

The no-nonsense approach to FOIA has a very low tolerance for abusive
behavior. Do not heap rotten fish guts on yourself before visiting the
township hall to make a point about your opinion of the township clerk,
and do not fill your request or appeal letters with mean-spirited 
words. Be straightforward and to the point, and you will get better 
results.
