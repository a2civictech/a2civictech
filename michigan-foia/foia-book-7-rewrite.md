# Chapter 7: Rewriting your FOIA request for better success

If you have been turned down or disappointed in your FOIA request,
don't despair. Even if you were rejected the first time, you can
create a completely new request asking for something slightly or completely
different, and start the process again.



## Ask again in person

First, before writing yet another frustrating request, consider
scheduling an appointment with the head of the administrative
body (the mayor, e.g., or a city administrator or department head).
Explain what you are looking for in plain language and be prepared
to justify your request. An appeal to reason can bypass the need
for further appeals or an eventual lawsuit.

You may have been frustrated in your original request because the
records you seek have a different name or structure than what you
asked for. A cordial conversation that starts "how do you organize
information about x" may be all you need to get past the mystery
of writing a request that gets back what you want.

## Reduce the scope of your records request

One of the frequent reasons that FOIA requests get unfulfilled is
that they ask for too much all at once. By reducing the scope of
your request, you can make it easy for the organization to look
carefully for just what you're after. Once you've found that it's
possible to move forward.

As an example, a naive first FOIA request will ask for "all records"
pertaining to some issue. Conceivably this could require the agency
to search its entire system for the information, a search which is
nearly impossible to fulfill in a timely manner. You can reduce the
scope in a few of the following ways:

* By name. Ask for records held by an individual, rather than the
whole organization. You'll want to do your homework to identify the
individual, but once you have that single person in your request,
a search will be narrow enough to complete.
* By department. If you know the departmental structure, take advantage
of it to restrict your search to records held by just one part of
the organization.
* By record type. If you can identify specific forms, document types,
or other structures that the public body regularly uses to store or
create records, you can speed the efforts.
* By software used to store records. Examine your public body's
expenditures on information technology, and be aware of which 
system they store their records in.

The smaller the scope of your request, the more likely it is that you
can direct the public body to look for something that actually exists,
or to get a "no" answer that really means that it doesn't exist.

## Ask for reports, not raw data

Look for reports that have been compiled internally or commissioned by
an external consultant. These often have a level of detail that answers
a lot of questions, and further narrows the scope of the request. As
a bonus, it's unlikely that an internally published report or document
will need extensive redaction.

Reports that have cost a lot of money to produce are often full of
details that would be hard to get via FOIA requests, because the
consulting firm responsible for the report obtained access to internal
details as well as internal cooperation to produce new details.

## Examine meeting minutes and agendas

The agendas, board packets, and minutes of public and internal meetings
are a rich source of detail that can help you find the information that
you are looking for. Even just knowing who was or wasn't at a particular
meeting might be the clue that gives you enough knowledge to make
the next request more focused.

In many cases, a public body that holds public metings will prepare
board packets in advance for its board. Identify the clerk who makes
up these packets and ask to be added to the distribution list for the
information; this will give you advance notice of what the future
will bring.

## Limit the time span you are looking for

Rather than asking for all records throughout all time,
scope the search to records created within a given month or year.
If the organization stores its archives in an orderly way, this
will let them search just a portion of their files rather than the
whole thing.

## Learn how to search public records data for free

Spend time with the organization's web site and learn how to do
searches through their published databases. You can generally ask
public relations or technology staff for assistance, and if you find
someone cooperative you can get a lot of the questions you are after
answered without resorting to a formal written request.

## Ask public interest groups for assistance

When all else fails, turn to a public interest group and ask for
help. Several helpful organizations are listed in Appendix A.
