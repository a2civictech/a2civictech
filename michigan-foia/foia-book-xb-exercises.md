# Appendix B.. Exercises for Sunshine Week

Each year journalists celebrate Sunshine Week, which features 
stories based on open government and access to public records.
The work is usually done in February, often with the help of
journalism students and interns, leading to stories published
in March.

Here are some of the ideas that journalists have come up with
to exercise FOIA compliance and to do a broad audit of the
quality and responsiveness of public bodies in their area to
public records laws.

## Make the same request to many organizations at once

One of the favorite Sunshine Week techniques is to send out
FOIA requests in bulk to FOIA coordinators across a region
or state and see how well they all comply with what should
on its face be a straightforward request.

## Audit compliance with basic records laws

Sunshine Week participants will go into public offices and
ask for records in person, in order to determine how well
staff handles in-person requests. This is often done with
police records like logs of arrests or other information that's
sensitive but public.

## Ask multiple agencies for the same record

When a record is held by multiple agencies, such as a letter
or report that has been sent to multiple places, a Sunshine
Week inspired approach is to ask multiple public bodies for
the same record. This can expose wildly different costs,
redaction methods, and speed of response.

## Request FOIA log files of other FOI requests

Ask for the FOIA log of other requests. Typically this
gives you an insight into what other people are asking
from your municipality or agency.

## Repeat the same FOIA request at intervals 

Sunshine Week is too often a one-time task. Repeat the same exercise
at intervals throughout the year to keep a public body on its toes.
