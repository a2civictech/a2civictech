# Foreword

The Michigan Freedom of Information Act, and its companion the
Michigan Open Meetings Act, were passed in 1976 in the wake of the
Watergate scandal, led by the efforts of the late Rep. Perry Bullard.
The laws provide citizens with the right to examine and view the
workings of their government and to examine the records that it produces.

This guide was written from 2012 to 2014  and is based in part on a
series of articles written for AnnArbor.com during 2010 and 2011 and
a similar series for the Damn Arbor weblog in 2013 and 2014.
It illustrates in plain language how and why you might use FOIA
laws to obtain government documents. The guide should be useful for
people involved in the political process, as well as for businesses
that work or want to work on government contracts. From fixing a
broken sidewalk to obtaining a crime report, the Michigan Freedom
of Information Act is a versatile tool to ensure that you are not
ignored when it is your turn to deal with City Hall.

To whatever extent possible, this work also makes comparisons with
other state FOIA laws as well as the Federal FOIA statutes.
The basic recommendations that don't depend on particular statutes
are all very reusable, and it is hoped that this guide has wide
appeal beyond the boundaries of the Great Lakes State.

## Outline 

Chapter 1 introduces with Michigan Freedom of Information Act with
a sample FOIA request, illustrating the basic elements of such a
request. Chapter 2 follows with a list of the types of information
that you might be interested in getting through the FOIA process.
Chapter 3 addresses fees for FOIA requests and makes practical
suggestions on how to minimize your costs. Chapter 4 looks at how
to make your FOIA request go through the system quickly, and looks
at delays in the process that you can avoid.

Not every FOIA request is successful on the first try, and it is
important in your use of the FOIA process to know how to appeal a
rejected request. Chapter 5 looks at exemptions written into the
Michigan FOIA laws that allow a government to refuse to provide
records that it holds. Chapter 6 discusses the appeals process, and
provides a sample FOIA appeal for a rejected request. Chapter 7
looks at how you can rewrite a rejected request to get a positive
answer for a modification of your original request, and Chapter 8
looks at some cases where organizations have gone to court to pursue
their appeals through the judicial system.

Chapter 8x illustrates the defensive side of the Freedom of Information
Act, and is designed for public officials in public bodies that wish
to withhold, obstruct, or deny access to public records all within
the scope of the law. Followed scrupulously, these tactics can 
frustrate and intimidate potential public records requesters and
keep public records private.

Closely related to the Michigan FOIA laws is the Michigan Open
Meetings Act, which ensures that meetings of public bodies are
conducted in public. Chapter 9 looks at the practical aspects of
open meetings laws, and Chapter 10 looks at remedies that you can
pursue if you believe that a meeting has been held out of the public
eye.

You'll find lists of organizations that support the Freedom of
Information Act in the appendix, as well as a list of exercises
suitable for groups looking to test or audit the FOIA behavior
of a public body.

## About this edition

This is an early draft of the book. The basic outline is complete,
but several chapters are nearly empty, and others are partially
complete. Only a few people have seen the manuscript, and the bits
that are specific references to Michigan state laws have not been
footnoted.

This draft starts to introduce details from other states and from
Federal FOIA laws, and the process of working that detail in will
take some time.

Federal FOIA law is considerably more complex in its day to day
operations than the equivalent requests aimed at your average small
Michigan city, and the Federal portions of this work need review
by someone more familiar with all of that process.
