# Chapter 8. FOIA Lawsuits

If you have exhausted your patenince with internal FOIA remedies like
appeals, you may be prompted to take your case to court. MCL 15.240
describes the process.

## When to consult an attorney

In general, it's worthwhile to exhaust all of your administrative
appeals before going to court. Appealing a denial to the head of
an administrative body is free, and doesn't require paying filing
fees or court costs.

Michigan law provides that if you win a FOIA case, that you can
recover attorney's fees from the public body. In addition, there
is at the judge's discretion an additional $500 punitive fee that
can be assessed if the public body has "arbitrarily and capriciously"
violated the act. 

## Time limits to go to court

From the final determination of a public body to deny a request,
an individual has 180 days to file a lawsuit.

## Which court your request can be heard in

"The circuit court for the county in which the complainant resides
or has his or her principal place of business, or the circuit court
for the county in which the public record or an office of the public
body is located has venue over the action."

## Lawsuits as political statements

If you need a pretext to bring a public body to court, Freedom of
Information Act lawsuits are an easy one. Even the slightest redaction
is grounds for starting the litigation process.
