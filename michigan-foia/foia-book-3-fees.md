# Chapter 3. Fees, and how to minimize them.

Freedom is not free, and FOIA requests can cost significant amounts
of money to prepare and fulfill. By carefully structuring your
FOIA request, you can minimize those costs, both to you and to
the civic authority that you are requesting records from. In many
cases a well-researched request will turn up details that are
available without charge from a municipal web site without even
needing to file a FOIA request at all.

The basic structure of fees for a Michigan FOIA request includes
a labor charge and a materials charge. Any labor used to produce
the request may be charged back at the wage of the lowest paid
person capable of fulfilling the request, and materials costs like
photocopying or production of CD-ROMs are at the discretion of the
agency.

Michigan law allows for fees, but does not mandate that an agency
charge them for every request. In practice, routine requests that
are easily fulfilled with just a few minutes work by a clerical
employee are often done without charge.

If you have questions about fees, especially for a large request,
ask up front for a copy of the organization's Freedom of Information
Act policy. 

## Avoid FOIA, and ask verbally for information, not records

One way to avoid paying fees for records requested via FOIA is to
talk to your elected officials, clerks, and administrators, and ask
verbally for information about the material you seek.  You may find
that you can get same-day service and generous help by asking nicely
in circumstances where a bureaucratic FOIA request would result in
long delays and unreasonable fees.

It is always important to cultivate relationships with people
in government if you are looking to gather a lot of information
from that government unit at minimum cost. FOIA is by its nature
an adversarial process, and if you have warmed up the relationship
so that it does not seem like a tiresome and burdensome request,
everything will go more smoothly.

Not every organization will be able to pull off a strategy like this.
There are obstructionist bureaucrats, incorrigable requesters, and
resource-strapped legal departments that delay requests beyond their
due date as a matter of course because they can. Finding a friendly
contact within a big government unit might take a lot of time, and
it's likely to also save you a lot of time and money once you do.

## Specify a maximum amount you are willing to pay

Every single FOIA request should have language in it that specifies
a maximum that you are willing to pay, and that maximum should be
a reasonable estimate on your part of how much you expect to pay.

For routine requests, like meeting minutes, policy documents, meeting
agendas, and other records which should not require redaction, you
should specify that you do not expect there to be any cost to the
request.

Some suggested language reads

{code=text}
~~~~~~~~~

I am willing to pay up to $10.00 to satisfy this request. If
the costs for fulfilling the request are expected to exceed
$10.00, please provide an itemized summary of expected costs
before proceeding with the request. Please consider waiving
these fees, as the results of this query will contribute to
the public interest.

~~~~~~~~~

If you expect the request to have no costs, write this as follows:

{code=text}
~~~~~~~~

Because these documents have already been prepared and distributed
to the public, I expect that there will be no cost in providing
me with an existing electronic copy. If there are any costs 
for fulfilling this request, please itemize them before proceeding
with this request.

~~~~~~~~

## Request electronic records

Ask for records in electronic format if you possibly can. This 
eliminates the need to print copies, makes the resulting information
more reusable, and generally cuts costs.

It may be necessary for the agency to redact records to remove
material that is exempt from disclosure. Unless they have all-electronic
redaction software - a rarity - you may end up paying for a copying
step even if you get the end result electronically.

Many modern photocopiers have a scanning option, and you may have
to remind your municipal staff how to use it. You may end up with
PDF files that are simply scanned images of documents, but modern
OCR software is helpful in dealing with that.

## Ask to inspect records before copying them

If the set of information you are looking for is large, it may
make sense to request to inspect the records in person before
making any copies. Bring along a high resolution camera and
photograph any pages you need.

Some agencies will charge you for the time of a person
to watch over you while you are looking at the records,
and if redaction is necessary, there may still be a cost
to review and remove sensitive information.

## Avoid redaction

One of the most expensive tasks that a municipality can undertake
is the detailed redaction of records in order to selectively blank
out materials that are exempt from FOIA. A complex redaction 
process can involve legal staff and will add both time and cost
to your work. When possible, answer your questions without looking
for records (especially electronic mail) that are prone to redaction
requirements.

One of the easiest ways to get a lot of information with minimum
delay associated with redaction is to ask for meeting minutes,
meeting agendas, and board packets for upcoming meetings. In almost
every case any redaction needed on these materials has already been
done, and thus you can get the same materials that decision makers
are looking at with only the most minimum costs.

## Ask for a fee waiver

It never hurts to ask for a waiver of fees. This is especially true
if you have gone to some effort to minimize the costs that you
are willing to pay, if you've refined your request so that it's 
easy to fulfill, and especially if you can show that your request
is in the public interest. Be prepared to describe how your work
will primarily beneifit "the general public", rather than enrich
you or your company personally.

The language of the Michigan law reads:

> A search for a public record may be conducted or copies of public
> records may be furnished without charge or at a reduced charge if
> the public body determines that a waiver or reduction of the fee
> is in the public interest because searching for or furnishing copies
> of the public record can be considered as primarily benefiting the
> general public.

Many agencies will routinely waive fees for routine requests, e.g.
those which take less than an hour of the time of a clerk. 

## Divide a big request into smaller requests

One good way to keep costs in check is to ask for a fraction of the
records that you will eventually want, so that you can follow up with
a second request more narrowly focused that costs less to produce.

For example, instead of asking for 

{code=text}
~~~~~~~~

1. The rental inspection report for every parcel in the city of Arbopolis

~~~~~~~~

consider first minimizing that request to 

{code=text}
~~~~~~~~

1. The rental inspection report for every parcel in the 200 block of
Broad Avenue in the city of Arbopolis

~~~~~~~~

and then inspect what you get so that your subsequent conversations with
the rental inspection department are better informed.

## Publicize unreasonable fee requests

If you are asked to pay an outrageous sum of money for a FOIA request,
publicize the problem. There have been some astounding fees requested,
like a Mackinac Center request for records from the Michigan State Police
that yielded the $6.8 million estimate of costs.

http://www.mackinac.org/12443

Of course, your cost might be absurdly high because you've asked for
something nearly impossible to produce. If your request has overreached
itself, the public body is allowed to reject it as "overly broad". 
For example, XXX

## Negotiate fees

If the fees that you are quoted are too high, file an appeal to have
them reduced. The Michigan FOIA law does not have a specific option to
appeal fees, but it can't hurt. Take your argument directly to the
FOIA coordinator and negotiate a simpler request that costs less, or
take it to the head of the administrative body and ask that fees be waived
in your case.

## Ask for a detailed breakdown of costs

If you get an unreasonable bill for work, ask the agency to break
down the costs in detail so that you can see what you are being
charged for. Your request for a detailed review may be enough
to trigger a change of heart for costs, or it may provide you with
the detail you need to switch around your query so that it avoids
expensive parts of the effort.

## Ask for documents that have already been released

One very easy way to get interesting documents is to ask for 
copies of other people's FOIA requests. Ask to inspect the
log of existing FOIA requests, where you'll see the queries
that others have already done and the cost to them of making
those queries. Your request for a copy of an existing FOIA
response should be prompt and low cost, since all of the 
redaction and search costs have already been borne by someone
else and all that needs to be produced is an exact copy of
something already released.

## Double check the math

This sounds like a trivial thing, but make sure that if you have
per-page charges for documents, that you are being charged the correct
amount per page. One request I made came back with a fee marked as over
$100.00. It turned out that I had specified on the request that I was
unwilling to pay more than $10.00, and also that I was being charged
$0.50 per page instead of $0.05 per page for photocopies.
