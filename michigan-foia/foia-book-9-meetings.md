# Chapter 9. Michigan Open Meetings Act

The Michigan Open Meetings Act is designed to ensure that public
bodies make their decisions in public. It provides requirements
for notifying citizens of upcoming meetings, furnishing prompt
copies of meeting minutes, and ensuring that decision making bodies
do not meet in secret. There are specifically limited reasons
why a public body is allowed to meet in a closed session.

It can be difficult for an engaged citizen to keep track of all of
the possible government bodies that might hold meetings that would
affect their property, their livelihood, or their ability to enjoy
the community. This is especially true in an age of Internet media
where smaller news gathering operations ignore some smaller public
bodies entirely. If you are in a community where no daily newspaper
is there to take detailed notes for you, it is worthwhile to be prepared to
attend meetings and to insist on a timely record of their outcomes.

## Notification requirements

(Specific notifications spelled out in the law; get the time frames
exactly right.) XXX

Just because a meeting has been properly noticed under the law does
not necessarily mean that you as a citizen will have been likely to
see the meeting notice. Some municipalities print their legal notices
in the least expensive print publication that meets the requirements,
even if that paper is a specialized newspaper only targeted
at members of the legal profession. 

Some public bodies have decided to skip print publication entirely
and rely solely on electronic distribution of notices, a measure
which makes it difficult for those without ready access to computers
to get access.

## Meeting locations

In general, public meetings should never be held in private residences.
The sole exception is the case where no non-residential building is
available at no cost within the boundaries of the local government or
school system. If you find that a meeting is scheduled to be held
in someone's house, double check with the clerk in charge or the
head of the public body to let them know. 

## Postings at city hall; the tackboard

The front entryway of most main offices of official buildings has
a posting board designed to provide a citizen with a single place
to review upcoming meetings. In a well run municipality, this will
be a glass case locked with a key so that only a clerk can get postings
online, and the postings themselves will be signed and dated to
verify that the legal requirements for notification have clearly
been fulfilled.

Sometimes the ideal is less than ideal, and it can be hard to find 
official notices even when they have been posted in nominal adherence
to the law. A tack board that anyone can post anything to could suffice,
and an official notice could be buried underneath flyers advertising
retirement parties and fire department open house dates. If such a tack
board exists at your favorite unit of local government, it's a sign
that local government has not provided enough attention to its open
meetings obligations.

Tack boards that are accessible to the public are particularly
bad ideas, because it's possible for a member of the public to
deliberately or inadvertently remove an official notice, thus
making the municipality or school system in technical violation of
the open meetings law.

## Meeting minutes availability

(Exact timing for meeting minutes)

## Minutes promptly available

When the recording secretary or clerk of a public body takes
minutes for a meeting, those minutes become public records and
are to be made available to the public. The minutes are to be
precise enough to identify who voted which way on roll call votes,
what decisions were made, and the members who were there. 

There is not one single required format for minutes. Some public
bodies will provide details of the discussion as it happened, and
others will simply record the minimum necessary to reflect decisions
that were made.

Before a public body accepts a set of minutes as final, the members
of the board vote in a subsequent meeting to approve those minutes.
The not yet approved minutes are "draft minutes", and are to be made
available within 8 business days of the meeting. "Final minutes", 
approved with any corrections, are to be made available within 5 business
days of being finalized.

## Requesting minutes

When meeting announcements are posted, a contact person is named on
that posting giving a point of contact for that organization. You
can request directly to that individual to see meeting minutes, or
you can go through the usual Freedom of Information Act process to
get copies of minutes.

## Closed sessions

It is permissible for a public body to go into closed session in a 
strictly limited set of circumstances. These include:

### Attorney-client privilege

But not for deliberation of policy

### Labor negotiations

### XXX

## Subcommittees and quorums

When public bodies form subcommittes that do not compose a quorum
of that body, it is OK for them to meet in private.

Some public organizations have a standing policy that all subcommittee
meetings are to be held as though they were governed by the Michigan
Open Meetings Act. 

## Recording meetings

Meetings of public bodies may be recorded, in audio and video form,
by members of the public. You can even stream the video live from
within the meeting room or broadcast it on a radio station.

Don't assume that you'll be provided with power outlets, microphones,
or even a convenient place to put your camera. Meeting places do not
need to have wireless internet access available to the public, and
most journalists covering city hall come equipped with a cellular
network connection if they are covering it live.

The public body may place restrictions on meeting recordings in order
to minimize the chance that the meeting will be disrupted.

The rules are different for courtrooms.

## Getting notified about future meetings

Public bodies must post an annual schedule of meetings for the
upcoming year, and such a schedule should be available by request.
