# Chapter 1: A sample FOIA request

The best way to write a better FOIA request is to see some examples
of the system in action. Here are some basic principles to follow,
with a sample letter that illustrates the process.

## Be nice! Seriously. Be overly nice.

Get straight to the point in your request for records, and do not
fill your request letter with polemics, anger, invective, or other
extraneous rhetoric. Keep the request letter as simple as possible,
to ensure that it is handled as a matter of routine and so that the
clerk is not distracted by a stray argument.

Be pleasant and direct, especially in person. The staff of a public
body has a lot of discretion in how quickly to answer your request,
and you can avoid needless delays by not making yourself unwelcome.

The FOIA process can be adversarial, and you may have to disagree
with the person answering your request and go over their head to a
higher ranking official to make an appeal. It's always good to keep
cordial relationships with people who you are dealing with, even if
they seem unreasonable, because angry diatribes never help your cause.

## Who can request records

Any person can request records via the Michigan FOIA laws, except
those who are incarcerated. [MCL 15.232(c)] This includes corporate "persons",
and persons who are not based in Michigan.

If you are requesting records from a police agency, it's possible
that you will be asked to provide positive identification before
receiving records, so that they can check to see that you are not
an incarcerated individual. 

The various states have differing rules on who can access public records.
The most restrictive include Virginia, where you must be a citizen
of the state to access records. The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld
this decision in the case of McBurney v. Young in 2013. 

## Forms and formats

Michigan FOIA laws do not specify a particular format that a request
must be provided in.  As long as a request for records is provided
in writing, it should be handled by the government body as a FOIA
request and passed along to the individual who coordinates FOIA
responses. In practice, it is always best to contact the body that
you are requesting records from and identify who the request should
be addressed to. 

Many public bodies will provide a pre-printed form on which a FOIA
request can be filed. If such a form is provided, you should get
a copy of it to ensure that any matter of fact details like phone
numbers and addresses are copied correctly into your request. 

You're better off writing your own letter than using a pre-printed
form.  As noted in chapter 3, a carefully written request letter will
minimize the costs of a request, and most provided forms do not
include a key piece of language that can save you time, trouble,
and money. Never sign a preprinted form that says "I agree to pay
all fees associated with this request". 

## Who to send your request to

You may find that the city clerk, city attorney’s
office, communications office, or township supervisor is ultimately
in charge of FOIA requests. If there is any question, contact the
office of the highest ranking official and ask to whom a FOIA request
should be addressed. The law refers to a "FOIA coordinator", and if
you send your request through the mails to that person, it should
get through even if you don't know their name.

It's also likely that larger organizations have online FOIA information,
and that may help as far as identifying the best point of contact.
Examine or search the municipal web site with the search string
"FOIA" or "Freedom of Information" to locate on-site information.
You are looking for online forms, policies, costs associated with
your request, and other information about how to contact the public body.

## Which organizations are subject to the Michigan FOIA laws

Michigan cities, townships, public libraries, state agencies,
transit agencies, municipal utilities, regional authorities, and
other similar forms of government are subject to the Michigan Freedom
of Information Act. The law [MCL 15.232(d)] specifically exempts
the office of the governor and the judiciary, and an Attorney
General's ruling exempts legislators.

Non-profit organizations are not generally subject to Freedom of
Information Act requests. They are, however, required to submit
a Form 990 to the Internal Revenue Service, and may be able to
provide that financial information upon request.

There is a small gray area in the Michigan law about non-profits that are
subject to FOIA requests. If a non-profit gets the majority of
its support from a public body, it may be subject to FOIA requirements.
In practice, organizations that are not public bodies fight these
FOIA requests, and you may need to go to court to win the records
you want.

## Outsourcing and public-private partnerships

If a public body has contracted out work to a private organization,
they may only posess a fraction of the records which would normally
be held by that public body if it was doing the work itself. This
so-called "public private partnership" often results in the public
body not providing as much information in response to a public records
request as expected.

As an example, the Ann Arbor Downtown Development Authority contracts
with Republic Parking for management of municipal parking garages.
The DDA gets periodic reports from Republic of structure usage and
income, but it does not hold the individual records of each person
who parked or how full the structures were at any interval.

It's not atypical to see a FOIA policy read like this from the Michigan
Department of Community Health:

> (D)ocuments which are possessed _only_ by another agency or an
entity under contract with the Department do not constitute the 
public records of the department.

## Get it in writing

FOIA requests in Michigan must be made in writing. A verbal request
for records is not considered a FOIA request, and the laws that
ensure a timely response do not apply to verbal requests. If you
really want to find something out through this process, you must
write down your question.

Written requests include paper letters, facsimile transmissions, and
electronic mail. Note that many organizations start their clock for
having received an electronic request to the next business day.
If time is of the essence, a hand-delivered paper request handed to
the official in charge with a conversation about the urgency of the
request may be your fastest approach.

Note that not every organization in the state has a formal procedure
for handling FOIA requests by email, though they should. You may
be asked to send in a paper letter or to transmit your request by fax.

## Ask for records, not information or data

Michigan public bodies are not obliged to create new records in response to a
FOIA request, and you should not expect that broad requests for
information will be answered the way that you expect. Instead, seek
out existing records (paper or electronic) that will help you
determine the information you want. You may discover in the course
of getting an answer to your first query that a second query is
necessary; if so, repeat the process until you are satisfied.

This is one of many examples where a friendly relationship
with individuals inside a public body can help your search for
records. You are not entitled to a report if such a report
does not yet exist; yet, if you get someone to run that report
for you and tell you what it's called, you can subsequently
request it.

In your search for records, make note of any form numbers, codes,
or other unique identifiers for documents. The process of doing a
search for records goes much faster if you can provide an unambiguous
unique key for the agency to search on. Broader queries take longer
and may be more expensive. 

## The risk of your request being filed as spam

Make in plainly clear in your request letter that you are making a
request under the act.  You may get faster response via electronic
mail if your Subject line also includes the word FOIA. Beware that
some agencies with overly aggressive spam filtering on email may
divert your message into their spam mailbox; it is always appropriate
to follow up an email with a subsequent "did you get my message"
phone call if a timely answer is required.

## Formatting your request

If you are asking for more than one thing, number your requests.

If you expect that some of the records that you request will be
redacted, e.g. for personal privacy reasons, specify that the agency
should separate out the parts of the request that it can fulfill
from those that it won’t to ensure that you get as much information
as you can.

## Limiting your costs

To save duplication costs, ask for your records in electronic format.
This not only saves paper but can dramatically reduce the cost of
fulfilling the request.

Set a maximum amount that you are willing to pay for your request,
and do not agree to have the agency do the work for any more than
that maximum unless you give a specific go-ahead. There may be
something that you asked for that you thought should be easy to
provide that turns out to be expensive, and you want to leave room
for negotiation.

Always ask for a waiver of fees in the case where anything you do
will be shared with the public. Michigan FOIA law provides for
discretion by the public body whether or not to assess a fee, and
many organizations provide responses for free when the time spent
compiling a response is small enough to be considered routine, e.g.
less than an hour of a clerk’s time. (See more on fees in Chapter
3.)
